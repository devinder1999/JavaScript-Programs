    Example: Conditional statement is optional
The below code demonstrates that the conditional statement in the for loop is optional. However, 
if you don't write any condition, it will make infinite iterations. 
So, you can use the 'break' keyword with the for loop to stop the execution of the loop, as we have done in the below code.

   <h3>Output</h3> <p id = "output"> </p>
    <script>
        let output = document.getElementById("output");
        let arr = [10, 3, 76, 23, 890, 123, 54]
        var p = 0;
        for (; ; p++) {
            if (p >= arr.length) {
                break;
            }
            output.innerHTML += "arr[" + p + "] -> " + arr[p] + "<br/>";
        }
    </script>
</body>
