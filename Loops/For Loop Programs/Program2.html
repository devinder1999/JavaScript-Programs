    Example: Initialization is optional
    The below code demonstrates that the first statement is optional in the for loop. You can also initialize the variable outside the loop and use it with the loop.
    
    Whenever you need to use the looping variable, even after the execution of the loop is completed, you can initialize a variable in the parent scope of the loop,
     as we have done in the below code. We also print the value of p outside the loop.<br>

    <h3>Output</h3><p id = "output"> </p>
    <script>
        let output = document.getElementById("output");
        var p = 0;
        for (; p < 5; p++) {
            output.innerHTML += "P -> " + p + "<br/>";
        }
        output.innerHTML += "Outside the loop! <br>";
        output.innerHTML += "P -> " + p + "<br/>";
    </script>
</body>
